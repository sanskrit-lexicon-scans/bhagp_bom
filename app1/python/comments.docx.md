VOLUME I

Error in internal pages:  
Page 192 – ipage 8b AFTER page 193 \- ipage 7a (error in ipages)  
\------

The scan missed some pages:  
Page 428 – ipage 40b AFTER page 429 – ipage 42a (missed 2 pages – 41a, 41b)  
Page 540 – ipage 16b AFTER page 541 – ipage 18a (missed 2 pages – 17a, 17b)  
Page 748 – ipage 9b AFTER page 749 – ipage 11a (missed 2 pages – 10a, 10b)  
\------

Two verses appear partly at the bottom of one page and partly at the top of the next page:

volume	page	sk.	adhy.	from v.	to v.	ipage  
I	639	(VI)	2	1	8a	5a  
I	640	(VI)	2	8b	12	5b

I	647	(VI)	3	17	24a	9a  
I	648	(VI)	3	24b	27	9b

Jim: The 'a' and 'b' work ok, but I changed to 'ab' and 'cd'
for consistency with Andhrabharati's Burnouf edition index.
('ab' means first two padas, 'cd' means last two padas.)
After this revision:
I	639	(VI)	2	1	8ab	5a
I	640	(VI)	2	8cd	12	5b

I	647	(VI)	3	17	24ab	9a
I	648	(VI)	3	24cd	27	9b

\-----

Pages 678-681 consist double numbering of verses from 33-1, 34-2, till 43-11. I ignored the second number and used only 33, …, 43\.

The skandha X consists of two parts, each part has separate numbering of internal pages (the 1st part – pp.,191-415, the 2nd part pp.419-622)  
\---  
One verse appears partly at the bottom of one page and partly at the top of the next page:

volume	page	sk.	adhy.	from v.	to v.	ipage  
II	606	(XI)	87	42	50a	94b  
II	607	(XI)	87	50b	50b	95a  

Jim: revised to as above in volume I
II	606	(X)	87	42	50ab	94b
II	607	(X)	87	50cd	50cd	95a
This is in not अनुष्टुभ्  meter.
\----

To check the page 878 – it is the last page of skandha XII – but it doesn’t belong to the last verse.  
\---

As well I did an Index for the last pages (after skandha XII) – maybe it will be useful.

Jim: With current app, don't know how to make available.
 These pages are माहात्म्य ( अथभागवतमाहात्म्य्प्ररंभः )
